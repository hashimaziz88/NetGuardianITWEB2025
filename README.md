NetGuardian is a cybersecurity project developed for the ITWeb Security Hackathon 2025 Clinching the Award of Best Overall User Interface, aimed at combating phishing attacks in real time. I co-led the technical implementation of an AI-driven threat detection system that integrates directly into users’ browsers through a custom extension. On the backend, we leveraged Python Flask to handle malicious link classification and Redis for efficient message queuing between services. I was primarily responsible for designing and building the interactive dashboard using Next.js, which provided real-time visualization of detected threats, URL logs, and system responses. The project emphasized secure data flow, responsiveness, and developer collaboration, with all source control and DevOps workflows managed through Git. NetGuardian showcased our team’s ability to combine frontend UX, backend intelligence, and cybersecurity awareness into a unified platform.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
